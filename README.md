A Product Management repository


Hi, my name is Theodora Isola.


I love to work with teams to build software products that users love 
(what's a product if users don't love it?).
My interest is to drive development, market launch, support users and 
keep improving amazing products.


## Typical activities include:
- Conducting Research
- Developing Strategy
- Communicating Plans
- Acting of Feedbacks
- Analysing Data
